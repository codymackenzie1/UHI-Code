              <p1 class="howtoplayp1">Pontoon is a card game, like Blackjack and 21, where the user has too get too 21 in order too win.<br>
              The main difference with Pontoon, is that the user is restricted in the amount of cards they can draw. As they can only hold up too five cards.<br>
              The game starts with the house dealing out two cards to the player. and themself.<br>
              In the case of the game on this site. The house is always set too 18. <br>
              This means that the player needs to get between 18 and 21.</p1>
