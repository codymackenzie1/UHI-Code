        <p1 class="rulesp1">Rules of Pontoon - <br>
        The player recieves two random cards at the start of the game. <br>
        The house draws two cards, one of which is face up and the other is face down. <br>
        This is to help the player somewhat decide, <br>
        if they want to draw to try and beat the house or not.<br>
        The players objective is too get 21, however the user can beat the house and still win.<br>
        The user beats the house if they draw higher and don't go bust.<br>
        Pontoon's rules are very similar too 'Blackjack' & '21'.
